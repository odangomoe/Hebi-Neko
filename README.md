# Hebi-Neko
Aggressive NodeJS Crawler abusing IPv6

This crawler is made to crawl NyaaTorrents from start to end in less then a day.

# How it works

Most rate limiting techniques are IP based, but since we live in the age of IPv6, it doesn't work that well against people with those, as a simple home internet customer may have 1208925819614629174706176 IP's.

This crawler abuses this by using X amount of IPv6's, and cycling through them.
also added is a CloudFlare anti-bot page solver. making it a very robust crawler.
